# Feature Flag Infrastructure Walkthrough (IMP-001)

This walkthrough documents the design and implementation of the Feature Flag Infrastructure for the oMLX repository, satisfying the requirements of IMP-001.

## Architecture

The Feature Flag subsystem is a foundational, zero-dependency architectural component designed to orchestrate safe migrations and code rollout in oMLX without muddying the core execution logic.

The system is strictly divided into three concerns:
1. **Definition (`models.py`)**: Strongly-typed `FeatureFlag` representations powered by `pydantic`.
2. **Registration & Resolution (`registry.py`, `resolver.py`)**: Responsible for gathering flags, storing them before boot, and resolving their values via a deterministic precedence hierarchy.
3. **Immutability & Access (`system.py`)**: Provides a runtime snapshot mechanism. After `take_snapshot()` is called during the `RuntimeBuilder` bootstrap phase, the registry is sealed, and components are provided an `ImmutableSnapshot` guaranteeing no flag changes mid-execution.

## Key Features

- **Strict Lifecycles**: All flags must explicitly declare their lifecycle stage (Shadow -> Experimental -> Dual Run -> Validation -> Primary -> Deprecated -> Removed).
- **Categorization**: Flags are categorized into domains (Runtime, Execution, Planner, Adapter, etc.) to aid in observability.
- **Precedence Hierarchy**:
  1. CLI overrides
  2. Environment Variables
  3. Configuration File
  4. Hardcoded Defaults
- **Thread-Safety via Immutability**: There are no global mutable dictionaries during execution. The snapshot pattern guarantees lock-free, deterministic behavior for the scheduler and execution threads.

## Precedence and Resolution

The `FeatureFlagResolver` determines the value of a flag using the precedence rules. By default, it derives the environment variable name programmatically (e.g., `my-flag` becomes `OMLX_FF_MY_FLAG`) but supports explicit `env_var_name` overrides in the `FeatureFlag` definition.

## Rollback Procedure

Because this PR only introduces infrastructure and changes no runtime behavior, rolling back is purely dropping the `omlx/feature_flags` directory. None of the existing features depend on it yet.

## Recommendations for IMP-002 (RuntimeBuilder)

1. The `RuntimeBuilder` should initialize the `feature_flags_system` during the **BOOTSTRAP** phase.
2. It should populate any CLI overrides or configuration file overrides before taking the snapshot.
3. It must call `feature_flags_system.take_snapshot()` to lock the flags, and then pass the `ImmutableSnapshot` into the dependency injection container for other components (like `Scheduler`, `ExecutionPlanner`) to consume.
